## Big lines

At first -> only on foot. Then we can target bike, ski, and event maybe car ?

Solution will be used as a fallback if NFC chipset does not work. But it can be used as a checkpoint, or a standalone solution too.

Detect people crossing the "*line*", and save video if not bib number was detected. If bib number is detected -> export it somewhere, and maybe save the video still for futur use.



## Hardware

The hardware must be put on a tripod if possible, as there is not much space / place to put the hardware once at the end of the race.

Fixed focal may be the right choice, still need to research on that.

## Software

No direct time calculation -> everything is working with timestamp (UTC)

Detect person -> check when person cross line.

Need some sort of memorisation of people in order to work correctly even with occlusion
