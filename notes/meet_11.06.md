## Current situation



Stereo calibration working ! 

Was blocked because hardware manager was not there !

Explored many algorithms for the stereo matching -> I should be able to find the one

Explored Mono depth algorithms -> not good enough for now, so out of the picture. Tested many things

Stereo algorithms. Wanna tests before exploring too much, because it seems like a deep rabbithole...

Asked people for help -> Jerome Darbellay -> Can I ask him for help ?? 

The stereo setup is being done now



## What's the near future plan

Prepare the recording for saturday -> **When are we making a reunion with the client ?**

I want to take good data saturday, to have good way to test my solutions

This means trying to sycronize at best usb cameras. Will not be perfect, but I think it will be good enough

I'm in parrelel trying to train a little better a model to recognize bib, found a better dataset (smaller but more quality)

I think i'm gonna need to label some data. To have person and bib number class in the same dataset, to not forget about person.


## My questions

Am I in good way ? Am I doing enough ? I'm thinking I do not have many results for the past week or so, it is alarming for me.

I'm hoping that this weekend will fix this by giving a clean way to test my entire pipeline, which will lead to meaningful statics
