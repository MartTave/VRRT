# Meeting 22.05.2025

## To talk about

- Results obtained with yolo for object detection
- Better to use color images
- Tracking is intergrated in yolo, and does not seem too complicated
- Re-id (re-identification) seems more complicated, but is still integrated. I have results with this too, but I need to check how far can I go with finetuning
- Many youtube videos to train on !
- Bib detector may be integrated, but I need to finetune the model if so. Did not look for a dataset for now
- Ready to take videos for saturday. Video slashed into 10 minutes. Save video before crashing. 

## To take saturday
- PC
- Rallonge
- Camera + webcams
- Trepied
- Scotch
- Ficelle
- Battery
- USB A to C cable for connection share
- Umbrella ?
