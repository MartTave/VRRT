Test depth estimation  precision : Run with a line at the ground. Timestamp made by human (seb). And video based detection -> DONE

Create visualizations :
Base video AND depth visu AND only detected bib visible (all other pixels are black) AND only persons visible
Idea : We may add annotations on what frame we read what in the bibs


And finally :
Clean datas, remove backups from final solution. Create a backup of everything cleanded on SSD/external. -> Backup done
Create videos clip of interesing things -> Draw only the thing we are interested in (for example only the persons we are looking for in the debug).

DO NOT FORGET TO BLUR FACES

If clips are small enough, we can add it in the github repo

create README -> we can put some results here, BLURRED FACES !!!
