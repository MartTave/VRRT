Test depth estimation  precision : Run with a line at the ground. Timestamp made by human (seb). And video based detection

Create visualizations :
Base video AND depth visu AND only detected bib visible (all other pixels are black) AND only persons visible
Idea : We may add annotations on what frame we read what in the bibs


If time allows :
Setup stereo -> precision estimation / comparaison with me running
